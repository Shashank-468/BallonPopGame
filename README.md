Ballon Burst Game is an interactive game which is used for colour identification. It was my project which i have done for my university. In this firstly I have to choose colour and then I have to pop maximum balloons in 60 seconds. It is made up of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some BootStrap Libraries.
